# Vendee-Globe-Data-Engineering-Business-Case-Azure

## Overview
I present the "Microsoft Azure Certified Data & AI Track Vendée Globe Business Case" repository, which represents a significant project completed during my participation in the Data & AI bootcamp at Techionista Academy. This project was inspired by the Vendée Globe, a challenging solo non-stop round-the-world sailboat race, and involved building a cloud-based Lambda Architecture in Azure to process telemetry data from sailing boats. The Lambda Architecture includes both real-time and batch-processing paths, facilitating the collection and analysis of sailing boat data. The primary objective is to deliver this data to a PowerBI dashboard, offering spectators a captivating view of the race's progress. Despite the absence of actual race data, I employed a Python application to simulate boat telemetry data for a fleet of 10 race participants. This data is sent to Azure's cloud infrastructure, where it is processed and displayed on the PowerBI dashboard.

This repository serves as a demonstration of my technical skills and ability to tackle complex real-world data engineering challenges. It showcases the successful completion of the Microsoft Azure Certified Data & AI Track Vendée Globe Business Case, highlighting the development of a Lambda Architecture, PowerBI dashboard, and integration of a Python race simulation app for data generation.

## Objective
Our primary objective was to develop a cloud-based Lambda Architecture on Microsoft Azure, incorporating Stream Analytics Job, Power BI, and Data Lake Gen 2. This architecture enables real-time and batch processing of telemetry data from sailing boats in the Vendée Globe race. The ultimate goal was to create an engaging Power BI dashboard, providing users with real-time race position tracking and rankings, despite the absence of live race data.
